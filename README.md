# yt-saver, a project by me.
I made this for fun, but it can be useful (for me atleast).
I use this myself to get music from youtube.
Hope this can help someone :)

# Design
yt-saver is designed to be keyboard-centered, inspired by [vim](www.vim.org). 
This is to improve efficiency and to get bacic things done quick.
Just ctrl v and enter, you have downloaded your youtube audio.

# Dependencies
yt-saver depends on customtkinter, depending on darkdetect and tkinter.
yt-saver also depends on pytube, this application is meant to be a visual frontend.
I test yt-saver on Python 3.11.
