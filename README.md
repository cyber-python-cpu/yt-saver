# yt-saver, a project by me.
I made this for fun, but it can be useful (for me atleast).
I use this myself to get music from youtube.
Hope this can help someone :)

# DISCLAIMER!
I take no responsibility over what you choose to do with this software!
Just as a maker of knives cant get sued for a stabbing their knives did, Only you are responsible for any copyright violations, etc.

# Design
yt-saver is designed to be keyboard-centered, inspired by [vim](www.vim.org). 
This is to improve efficiency and to get bacic things done quick.
Just ctrl v and enter, you have downloaded your youtube audio.

# Dependencies
yt-saver depends on customtkinter, depending on darkdetect and tkinter.
yt-saver also depends on pytube, this application is meant to be a visual frontend.
I test yt-saver on Python 3.11.
